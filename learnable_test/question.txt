# Learnable technical test question 


Given a list of integers, create a function that returns the nth-rarest item. The function should be called nth_most_ratesignature and its signature nth_most_rate_signature(list,n) where list is the array od integers and n is the nth rarest term. For example in ([5,4,5,4,5,4,4,3,3,3,2,2,1,5], if 2 is supplied as n, the answer is 2 as 2 is the 2nd rarest item).

# Another solution file. In case there is more than one item in the list from above solution, this will return all the values at the nth most rarest value.
e.g list=[2,3,3,4,4,5] in this list 3 and 4 are the 2nd most rarest values in the list.
