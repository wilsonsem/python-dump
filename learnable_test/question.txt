# Learnable technical test question 


Given a list of integers, create a function that returns the nth-rarest item. The function should be called nth_most_ratesignature and its signature nth_most_rate_signature(list,n) where list is the array od integers and n is the nth rarest term. For example in ([5,4,5,4,5,4,4,3,3,3,2,2,1,5], if 2 is supplied as n, the answer is 2 as 2 is the 2nd rarest item).
